# aoc2021

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in [kaze](https://github.com/yupferris/kaze) RTL.

expect only a few solutions, as this is not a particularly fun/rewarding thing to do :P (especially as kaze kinda sucks rn when it comes to trivial modules)

## setup

I'm using some "unreleased" stuff on kaze's master branch, so it's expected that that's checked out in a `kaze` dir alongside this repo, eg:

```
> ls .
aoc2021
kaze
```
